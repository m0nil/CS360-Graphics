Assignments for the course - CS360 (Computer Graphics), IIT Kanpur offered in 2024-25-I

<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<p>
  A 2D animated scene using only three basic shapes: square, triangle, and circle. Applying appropriate affine transformations to translate, rotate, and scale the shapes as needed with animation ...

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<p>
  Three different shading algorithms: 
  <ul>
      <li>Flat (per-face) shading, </li>
      <li>Gouraud (per-vertex) shading, and </li>
      <li>Phong (per-fragment) shading.</li>
  </ul>
  One canvas divided into three viewports, as shown below. Each viewport will have its own objects and will allow exclusive interaction using a mouse, i.e., when you are interacting with objects in one viewport, the objects in the other two viewports should stay as it is

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
<p>
  A 3D animated scene that will showcase 3D texture mapping on objects and cubemap environment reflection mapping on a teapot. A skybox to give context to the objects in the scene

<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
<p>
  A ray tracer in GLSL shader containing spheres for simplicity. Implementing ray-traced shadow and reflection. For reflection, perform multiple levels of reflection, by allowing multiple bounces of the reflected ray.
